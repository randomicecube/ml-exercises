# ml-exercises

Where I'll be adding my $\LaTeX$ solutions for IST's ML course's exercises.

Generally speaking, I'll probably be spending more time with explanations than
with showing every single calculation in the resolutions.
_However_, every calculation performed will be shown in each sheet's respective `.ipynb` file.

## To-do list

- [ ] Sheet 1 - Univariate Data Analysis (probably won't be done)
- [ ] Sheet 2 - Decision Trees
- [ ] Sheet 3 - Bayesian Learning
- [ ] Sheet 4 - Linear Regression, kNN
- [ ] Sheet 5-6 - Gradient Descent
- [x] Sheet 7-8 - Neural Networks
- [x] Sheet 9 - Clustering
- [x] Sheet 10 - Dimensionality Reduction
